# RedPillEnemySpawn
A Lethal Company mod to allow the Red Pill (Obunga) test enemy to spawn naturally

## What is this? Why did you make this??
First of all, I (Joshii) claim zero responsibility in the creation of the Obunga.png instakill enemy. Zeekerss put this in their game. Blame Zeekerss.

I did not know about this existing in the game (or the Obunga meme in general) until I found "RedPillTestEnemy" in the list of spawnable enemies,
and naively thought it'd be fun to try spawn it in. Then I saw this hellish bullsh*t.

"Obunga" is an entity that players have reported spawning very rarely during normal gameplay... even being sighted hiding underneath the company building!
Is it true, or were these players being trolled? It was probably the latter, but we're taking that myth and turning it into reality. It's terrifying.

So, why not let it spawn as a regular enemy to hunt you in your quest to meet quota?

## I installed the mod but I haven't seen Obunga anywhere! What gives?
Obunga is a rare species; just be patient, don't make sudden movements, and then maybe an Obunga will come out to play.
Or just edit the config file.

## Known Issues && Bugs
- Obunga does not move at configured base speed when no player is within detection range
- Obunga NEVER forgets its last assigned target and, despite no players being nearby, will continually attempt to move towards
- Obunga gives me nightmares (unfixable)

## Future Updates
- Louder enemy sound (configurable)
- Obunga ability to open doors (not by default, configurable)
- Different rarity for each hazard level (configurable)
- Obunga will not always know where you are (default, but configurable for my fellow deogen fans)
